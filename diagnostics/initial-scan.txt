CLIENT INITIAL SCAN
====================

FRAMEWORK DETECTION:
- Next.js 15.4.6 (App Router + Turbopack)
- TypeScript project
- React 18+ with modern architecture
- Package manager: npm (has package-lock.json)

API LIBRARIES DETECTED:
✅ @tanstack/react-query: ^5.85.0 (GOOD - modern caching library)
✅ axios: ^1.11.0 (detected)
⚠️  Raw fetch calls (detected in multiple files)
⚠️  Custom API client (src/lib/api/client.ts)

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
1. React Query is already installed - this is good for optimization
2. Multiple API patterns detected (axios, fetch, custom client)
3. Custom API client with retry logic exists
4. Health check polling system detected

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
- Modern React ecosystem with good performance libs
- TipTap for rich text editing (bundle size consideration)
- Clerk for authentication (managed service)
- Radix UI components (tree-shakeable)
- Motion/animation libraries (bundle impact)

INITIAL COST CONCERNS:
1. Mixed API patterns could lead to duplicate requests
2. Health check polling every 30 seconds
3. Multiple fetch patterns without central deduplication
4. No evidence of request batching

NEXT STEPS:
- Map all API call sites
- Identify polling/frequent requests
- Find duplicate data fetching patterns
- Measure baseline network usage
