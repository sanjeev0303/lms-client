# CORS Fix Implementation

## Problem
The deployed client at `https://lms-client-seven-delta.vercel.app` was experiencing CORS errors when trying to access the server at `https://lms-server-lw51.onrender.com`.

## Root Cause
The server's CORS configuration doesn't include the Vercel domain in its allowed origins.

## Solution Applied

### 1. API Proxy Configuration
- Updated `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from direct server URL to `/api`
- Configured Vercel rewrites to proxy `/api/*` requests to the server
- This makes all API requests appear to come from the same origin

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Production (Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api

# Development (Local)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://lms-server-lw51.onrender.com
```

### 3. Vercel Configuration
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/:path*",
      "destination": "https://lms-server-lw51.onrender.com/:path*"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
          "value": "*"
        },
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
          "value": "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"
        },
        {
          "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
          "value": "X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Authorization"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works
1. Client makes request to `/api/course/published`
2. Vercel proxy intercepts and forwards to `https://lms-server-lw51.onrender.com/course/published`
3. Server responds to Vercel (same-origin request)
4. Vercel returns response to client (same-origin response)
5. No CORS error occurs

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates CORS errors
- ✅ Consistent API base URL across environments
- ✅ No server-side changes required
- ✅ Maintains security with proper headers

## Alternative Solutions (if proxy doesn't work)
1. Update server CORS configuration to include Vercel domain
2. Use Next.js API routes as a middleware layer
3. Implement server-side proxy in the backend
